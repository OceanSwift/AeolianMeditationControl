Aeolian Meditation Control allows the user control of the Aeolian Meditation VSTi and or standalone synthesizer using an Android phone or tablet with full bi-directional control capability. Every parameter on the device is represented on the app, as well as enhanced functionality such as XY pads and randomizers.

The project is written in Java using Android Studio, and implements oscP5 by Sojamo as the OSC control library.

It is quite possible the code could have been written in a much cleaner and more efficient way, you are free to do with it as you like.

The linked libraries used for the sliders and OSC control are already included in the gradle build, there is no need to download them extra. They are:
